## How to Contribute

### Creating an issue
* Remember to include sufficient information if you're reporting a bug or hotfix.
* New features or functions are welcome.
* It is fine to Create an issue for asking questions.

### Creating a PR
Every PR will be considered.

#### How to increase the chance of having your PR merged

* Ask about the feature beforehand (or pick one of the open issues).
* If no issue exists, create an issue for the PR.
* Try to write some tests for your change. There are a lot of examples in the `test` dir.
* Format your code so it looks somewhat like the rest of the source (which is formatted using default settings in IntelliJ)

### How to run tests

`mvn test`

### How to install in local Maven repository for development testing
